/* What if we want the P tags always rabeccapurple? To it, we make the important declaration. 
To make an important declaration put "!important" after the tag  */
/* its not the best idea to use important declaration
It's good when you want to make one or two declarations, not too much of them
IF you make tomany of them you dont  really know which one is important */
