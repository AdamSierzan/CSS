            we would have to give it a class, to add some
            points to it. But if we just put class it will be only 10
            points, which is not eneough comparing to id that has 100 points
         -->
            <!-- We could put strong tag, and then color it i.e green. 
            It will be colored because, #main-content" is targering p tag
            so it will color everything with a p tag, however it's not targeting 
            strong tag, strong tag inherits red color from p tag, but we apply 
            our new color to it, so it changed  -->
